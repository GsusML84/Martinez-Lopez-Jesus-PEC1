	abstract = {The {POMA} package offers a comprehensive toolkit designed for omics data analysis, streamlining the process from initial visualization to final statistical analysis. Its primary goal is to simplify and unify the various steps involved in omics data processing, making it more accessible and manageable within a single, intuitive R package. Emphasizing on reproducibility and user-friendliness, {POMA} leverages the standardized {SummarizedExperiment} class from Bioconductor, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility with a wide array of Bioconductor tools. This approach guarantees maximum flexibility and replicability, making {POMA} an essential asset for researchers handling omics datasets. See https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/{POMAShiny}.
